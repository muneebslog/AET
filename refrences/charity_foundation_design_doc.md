# Charity Foundation Website Design Document

## 1. Design Philosophy

This website must feel **emotionally powerful, credible, and modern**.

Not NGO-generic.
Not corporate.
Not template-looking.

It should feel like:
- A global movement
- A faith-driven mission (if applicable)
- A transparent, structured organization
- A premium digital presence

The tone is **dignified, warm, confident, and trustworthy**.

## 2. Visual Identity

### Primary Emotion
Compassion + Urgency + Hope

### Color System

**Primary Color:** Deep Burgundy / Rich Crimson  
Used for hero background, CTAs, donation highlights.

**Accent Color:** Warm Gold or Soft Peach  
Used for highlights, badges, subtle glow elements.

**Base Background:** Soft Off-White / Light Beige  
Avoid pure white to reduce harsh contrast.

**Dark Sections:** Deep Maroon gradient overlays  
Used to create emotional intensity.

### Typography

- Headings: Bold, modern sans-serif with strong presence.
